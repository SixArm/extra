# The `extra` command for Unix text processing

Print the lines that are in any of the inputs.

Syntax:

    extra <input> ...

Example:

    $ extra 1.txt 2.txt
    => lines that are not in 1.txt, but are in 2.txt.


## Notes

The order doesn't matter.

In set theory, this command is (A extra B) a.k.a. (B - A).

This command is currently implemented using `awk` and POSIX.
